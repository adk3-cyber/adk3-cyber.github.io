subtitle: Why I'm Taking Electronic Textiles
---

My name is Arjun Kalra and I’m taking electronic textiles because it’s an amazing opportunity to learn about the intersection between the electronic and physical worlds. I have no experience with either. I cannot code and my fine motor skills are just about as bad as fine motor skills can possibly be. So I’m hoping to improve both skills in this class, learning to code and sew. If I can even learn to fix a tear in my coat or how to customize a website it’ll be a win.
